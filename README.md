## A Comprehensive Study on Developing a Hiking Assistance System

This project focuses on creating an innovative mobile application to enhance the hiking experience in Sri Lanka. The app will enable hikers to identify mountains in real-time using image recognition technology, access geolocation-based data, and retrieve comprehensive information about the mountains, such as height, geological features, historical significance, and more. The solution also incorporates features like hiking time estimation based on environmental and trail conditions, interactive maps with route sharing capabilities, and safety alerts for potential trail hazards. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, augmented reality (AR), and geospatial data analysis, the application aims to promote an educational, engaging, and safer environment for hikers. This system is particularly novel in the Sri Lankan context, addressing the current lack of real-time, reliable tools for mountain identification and hiking support.
